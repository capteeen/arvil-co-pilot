# Making ARVIL Accessible via npm

This document provides a comprehensive guide on making ARVIL available to everyone through npm.

## 1. Completed Preparation Steps

We have already prepared the following files and configurations:

- ✅ Updated `package.json` with the name `arvil-cli` and proper configuration
- ✅ Created documentation files (README.md, GETTING-STARTED.md, etc.)
- ✅ Set up scripts directory with postinstall.js
- ✅ Made CLI scripts executable
- ✅ Created .npmignore to control package contents
- ✅ Added LICENSE with MIT license
- ✅ Created CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- ✅ Created a final checklist for npm publishing
- ✅ Created one-line installer script

## 2. GitHub Repository Setup

Before publishing to npm, you need to create and set up a GitHub repository:

1. Create a new GitHub repository named "arvil"
2. Push the code to the repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/arvil.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## 3. npm Account Setup

1. Create an npm account at [npmjs.com/signup](https://www.npmjs.com/signup) if you don't have one
2. Login to npm in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm login
   ```
3. Verify you're logged in:
   ```bash
   npm whoami
   ```

## 4. Publishing to npm

1. Navigate to the arvil directory:
   ```bash
   cd arvil
   ```

2. Run the preparation script:
   ```bash
   ./prepare-package.sh
   ```
   This will run tests and create a tarball for local testing.

3. Test the package locally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g ./arvil-cli-0.1.0.tgz
   arvil --version
   ```

4. If everything works as expected, publish to npm:
   ```bash
   npm publish
   ```

5. Verify the package is available on npm:
   ```bash
   npm view arvil-cli
   ```

## 5. Post-Publishing Steps

1. Test the global installation:
   ```bash
   npm install -g arvil-cli
   ```

2. Create a GitHub release:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click on "Releases" > "Create a new release"
   - Tag version: v0.1.0
   - Title: ARVIL v0.1.0
   - Description: Initial release of ARVIL

3. Update one-line installer URL in README.md to match your actual GitHub repository

## 6. Sharing ARVIL with the World

Now that ARVIL is published, anyone can install it with:

```bash
npm install -g arvil-cli
```

Or using the one-line installer:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/arvil/main/install-arvil.sh | bash
```

## 7. Maintaining and Updating

When you need to update ARVIL:

1. Make your changes
2. Update the version in package.json (`npm version patch|minor|major`)
3. Run tests
4. Publish the new version (`npm publish`)
5. Create a new GitHub release for the new version

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Package name already taken**: Choose a different name in package.json
- **Version conflict**: Make sure to increment the version number
- **Permission errors**: Ensure you're logged in to npm and have the right permissions

## Next Steps

- Consider setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions for automated testing and publishing
- Create a project website for better documentation
- Gather user feedback and implement improvements
- Build a community around ARVIL
