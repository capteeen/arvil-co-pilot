## New Features in v0.1.5

ARVIL can now help you implement solutions by:

- **Automatic Code Block Detection**: ARVIL detects code blocks in AI responses
- **Execute Terminal Commands**: Run commands directly from AI suggestions
- **Create Files and Directories**: Generate files from code snippets
- **Track Created Files**: Keep a record of files created during your session

### Example Usage

```bash
# Get assistance with creating a Solana token
arvil assist "Create a simple SPL token on Solana"

# After the AI responds, you'll be prompted to:
# 1. Execute terminal commands (like installing dependencies)
# 2. Create files (like creating the token script)
# 3. Show a list of files created during your session
```
