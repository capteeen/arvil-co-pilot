## New Features in v0.1.5

ARVIL now operates like a Cursor Agent:

- **Automatic Code Implementation**: ARVIL automatically detects and implements code from AI responses
- **Seamless File Creation**: Files are created instantly without prompting
- **Command Execution**: Terminal commands are executed automatically (with safety checks)
- **Smart Filename Detection**: Intelligently extracts filenames from AI responses

### Example Usage

```bash
# Get assistance with creating a Solana token
arvil assist "Create a simple SPL token on Solana"

# ARVIL will automatically:
# 1. Create necessary files (like .env and createToken.js)
# 2. Execute safe terminal commands (like npm install commands)
# 3. Skip potentially unsafe commands that require manual review
```

## New Features in v0.1.7

ARVIL now includes smart error resolution:

- **Automatic Error Detection**: ARVIL detects errors during command execution and file creation
- **AI-Powered Error Analysis**: Analyzes error messages to determine the root cause
- **Automatic Resolution**: Applies fixes automatically without user intervention
- **Command Retry**: After fixing issues, automatically retries failed commands

### Example Error Resolution

```bash
# If a command fails with an error:
arvil assist "Create a React dApp that connects to Solana"

# ARVIL will:
# 1. Detect the error automatically
# 2. Use AI to analyze the error and determine a solution
# 3. Apply necessary fixes (install missing dependencies, fix config issues)
# 4. Retry the original command if appropriate
```

## Features in v0.1.6

ARVIL operates like a Cursor Agent: 

## New Features in v0.1.8

ARVIL now intelligently handles sensitive information:

- **Smart Placeholder Detection**: Automatically identifies when sensitive information like private keys is needed
- **Interactive User Prompting**: Securely prompts for sensitive information in the terminal
- **Automatic File Updates**: Updates configuration files with user-provided values
- **Environment Variable Management**: Manages .env files to store sensitive information securely

### Example User Prompting

```bash
# When ARVIL detects that sensitive information is needed:
arvil assist "Create a Solana wallet and token"

# ARVIL will:
# 1. Detect placeholders for private keys, API keys, wallet addresses, etc.
# 2. Securely prompt you for the information in the terminal
# 3. Save the information to your .env file automatically
# 4. Use the provided values in generated files and commands
