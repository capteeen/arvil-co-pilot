## New Features in v0.1.5

ARVIL now operates like a Cursor Agent:

- **Automatic Code Implementation**: ARVIL automatically detects and implements code from AI responses
- **Seamless File Creation**: Files are created instantly without prompting
- **Command Execution**: Terminal commands are executed automatically (with safety checks)
- **Smart Filename Detection**: Intelligently extracts filenames from AI responses

### Example Usage

```bash
# Get assistance with creating a Solana token
arvil assist "Create a simple SPL token on Solana"

# ARVIL will automatically:
# 1. Create necessary files (like .env and createToken.js)
# 2. Execute safe terminal commands (like npm install commands)
# 3. Skip potentially unsafe commands that require manual review
