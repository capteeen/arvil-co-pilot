You will need to create a banner image for your project.
Replace this file with 'arvil-banner.png' - a wide banner image (1280x320px recommended)
that displays the ARVIL logo and name.

For now, you can use the ASCII art from the CLI or create a simple image using tools like:
- Figma
- Canva
- Adobe Illustrator
- GIMP

Your banner should include:
- The ARVIL name
- Optionally a tagline "Blockchain AI Engineer"
- Visual elements related to blockchain and AI
